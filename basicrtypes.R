# c is used to combine the elements in the vector
y = c(1,2,3)
y^2
# 5 %/% 2 gives the quotient of result when 5 is divided by 2
#  a%%b represents a modulo b i.e. the remainder when a is divided by b
# min(elements) returns the minimum of values
# max(elements) returns the maximum of all values c can be omitted

# ceil(),floor()
# sum(values) reurns the sum of all values
# prod(values) reurns the product of all values
